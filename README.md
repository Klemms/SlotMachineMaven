# Slot Machine

Welcome to the repository of the Minecraft Spigot plugin Slot Machine

## Current State
This plugin was originally created a long time ago (more than 8 years ago) when I was still a student, over time some parts have been refactored but old and ugly code still exists.

## Contributions
Everyone is free to open pull-requests, once approved and merged, your name will be added to the README.md author list.

Always remember to not break the setup and settings of existing users, migration code that works for years must be added in case of big refactors.

## Help
If you need help, join the discord server, the invitation code is : `sZvy5KcH2R`

Changes merged to this repository will be distributed on Spigot on the following project page : https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/slot-machine.22023/

Slot Machine is licensed under the GNU GPLv3 license. You can find the license in the LICENSE file.
