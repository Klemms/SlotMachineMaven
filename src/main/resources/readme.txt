If you want to create your own language to use in the plugin :

1. Create a file in this folder with any name and the .properties extension, like "mylanguage.properties"

2. Edit the config.yml file and change the name of your file without the .properties extension, like "mylanguage"

3. Restart the server or reload the plugin


Tips :

- You can use the & symbol to color most messages (some may not work)

- You don't have to translate everything, just add what you want to translate from the original en-demo.properties file

- Anything that you don't translate will use the 'en' (English) translation as a fallback

- The en-demo.properties file will not be loaded and will be regenerated everytime the plugins loads, so don't touch it
